# PS2-keyboard

The main objective is to learn to use the FPGA to accept input from a PS/2 keyboard by the above said development kit. This assignment basically makes us write Verilog code in order to display numbers on the LEDs when keys are pressed on the keyboard. Here, we just use the numerical keys placed on the keyboard below the function keys.
	By the end of the experiment, we should be able to display the binary coded decimal on the available LEDs by pressing numerical keys on the keyboard.
